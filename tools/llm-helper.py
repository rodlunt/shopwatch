"""Answers shopwatch's wizard requests - "suggest a model number" and "find other
retailers selling this" - using YOUR OWN Claude Code or Codex CLI login - never an API
key, never a credential shopwatch holds or pays for. Run this on whichever machine
already has one of those CLIs installed and signed in; it can be the same machine
you're browsing shopwatch from.

Quick start:
    python3 tools/llm-helper.py --url https://shop.home.lunt.au --backend claude

No pip install needed - this script uses only the Python standard library. You will be
prompted for your shopwatch username/password the first time (the same ones you use to
open the site in a browser); pass --user/--password or $SHOPWATCH_USER/$SHOPWATCH_PASSWORD
to skip the prompt.

How it works: shopwatch's wizard queues a job ("suggest models for: Dreame RoboMower")
and waits. This script polls shopwatch every couple of seconds asking "anything queued
for me?", and when there is, asks your local `claude` or `codex` CLI the question and
posts the answer straight back. Nothing about your CLI login ever leaves this machine -
only the resulting suggestion text does.

Leave this running in a terminal while you use the wizard; Ctrl+C to stop any time.

Be short and honest:
- Return 0 to 5 candidates. Fewer, or zero, is the correct answer when you are not
  genuinely confident real models exist matching this description. A plausible-looking
  invented model number is worse than no suggestion at all.
- Only include a model you have specific, genuine knowledge of - not a guess at the
  pattern a model number "would" follow for this brand.
- If the product line is very new, or you are not confident your knowledge of it is
  current, say so in "note" rather than guessing at specific models.
