"""The wizard's "let's go" step, run from opti - never from inside the shopwatch container.

Mirrors app/mailwatch.py's existing wiring exactly: runs as a host-level script in its
own venv, sources the Claude Code OAuth token that already exists in
/srv/prod/career/runner.env (nothing new to store or rotate), and talks to the running
shopwatch container over plain HTTP on the docker network. The container never holds
this credential and never gains new outbound egress - only this script does.

Also claims app/retailer_search.py's queue: same host-level shape, but calling the
self-hosted Firecrawl instance on opti's own loopback (127.0.0.1:3002 by default,
$FIRECRAWL_URL/--firecrawl-url override it) instead of the Claude CLI. Firecrawl sits
on its own docker network, bound to 127.0.0.1 on the host, and is not reachable from the
shopwatch container's own docker network - this script CAN reach it because it runs
directly on the opti host, not inside a container. That is the whole reason this queue
is claimed here rather than called directly from app/main.py.

    ssh root@YOUR-SERVER-IP
    set -a; . /srv/prod/career/runner.env; set +a
    cd /srv/prod/shopwatch/repo
    export SHOPWATCH_URL="http://$(docker inspect shopwatch --format \
        '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}'):8477"
    /srv/prod/shopwatch/research-venv/bin/python deploy/research-runner.py --interval 10

Wired into opti as shopwatch-research-runner.timer, firing every 2 minutes via
shopwatch-research-runner.sh (see deploy/).

Default-deny is enforced server-side (research.create_job only ever queues retailer ids
that already exist in shopwatch's own retailers table), so this script never has to
decide which domains are in scope - it only ever sees retailers the job itself named.

Also claims a second kind of research_jobs row (issue #93): kind="historical_low" asks
"has this ever been cheaper" instead of "what's it selling for today", once per job
rather than once per retailer (process_historical_low_job). The finding is reported via
POST .../historical-low, never through /api/import - it is a best-effort estimate for a
human to confirm or discard on the product page, not a confirmed listing. Since that
same search inevitably turns up other retailers currently selling the product, issue
#98 has it also report those (best-effort, name + URL) on the same call, for the
product page to offer as tickable "add as a listing" candidates.
