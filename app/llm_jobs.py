"""LLM helper jobs: turn a rough product description into a short list of real
candidate model numbers, for the "Track something new" wizard's model field.

A job's own lifecycle lives here, in this container - same split as app/research.py.
The actual LLM call never runs in this process: it is claimed over this same HTTP API
by tools/llm-helper.py, a small standalone script the USER runs on their own machine,
authenticated with whatever Claude Code or Codex CLI login is already active there. No
API key, no credential of any kind, ever needs to exist on this server or in this
container - the whole point of this design is that it costs the operator nothing beyond
what they already pay for their own CLI subscription.

"Exact model" is used to match price imports (store.normalise_model), so a wrong
candidate silently accepted would corrupt matching later. Every candidate is therefore
presented to the person as something to verify, never applied automatically - this
module only ever returns suggestions into the wizard's own text field.
