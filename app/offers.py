"""Reading retailer marketing email for offers worth acting on.

The problem this solves, measured on a real corpus of 204 retailer emails: only 67
carried a quantified offer, and keyword matching flagged 44 of those as relevant when a
handful actually were. "$400 off" and the word "TV" both appearing somewhere in a 6,000
character catalogue blast says nothing. Working out what an offer covers means reading
it, so that step is done by a model with a fixed output schema.

The standing rule: **an offer is a lead, never a price.** Nothing here writes to a
listing's advertised price, freight or coupon. It produces a suggestion with the
arithmetic already done, and a human decides.
