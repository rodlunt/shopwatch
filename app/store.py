    the user typed in by hand - or a previous auto-fill they have not cleared - is
    never touched. It is a one-shot fill, not a standing link: once written, the value
    sits still (still labelled "auto" via *_price_auto) until either a human overwrites
    it, which locks it per update_product, or clears it back to null, which puts it
    back in scope for this function to fill again on the next call.

    historical_low_price = lowest_known_price exactly, same reasoning as excellent_price
    below: matching the actual recorded low IS what "historical low territory" means.
    Unlike the other two, this one is not just a display default - pricing.classify()
    reads historical_low_price directly, checked before excellent_price and trigger_price
    (app/pricing.py, HISTORICAL_LOW is checked first and wins ties). So on a product that
    already has a lowest_known_price and no historical_low_price set, this can change a
    listing's classification the moment it runs - a listing sitting at or under the known
    low newly rates HISTORICAL LOW TERRITORY instead of whatever it rated before. That is
    the intended behaviour (the classification was arguably wrong before, given the price
    data already on hand), not a side effect to guard against, but it is a real behavioural
    change on existing products the first time this ships, not only a cosmetic UI default
    the way the other two fields are. One consequence worth knowing: because both default
    to exactly lowest_known_price, the EXCELLENT tier has no width under pure auto-derived
    defaults - a price at or under the low always resolves to the better HISTORICAL_LOW
    rating instead. A human who wants a distinct EXCELLENT band back can always type over
    either threshold, which locks it.

    Called from every place lowest_known_price can change: update_product (a human
    typing it into the edit dialog, or confirming a historical-low research finding
    the same way), maybe_lower_known_low (auto-tracking beating the known low), and

    before #106 shipped, and has not been touched by any of those three paths since, sits

    future edit happens to fire one of them. Confirmed live: a product sat at "No trigger
    set" until a no-op Edit-Save was performed on it, at which point targets appeared
    correctly. This sweep catches every such product up on the next deploy instead of
    leaving it to chance.

    Tracked the same way app/migrations/*.sql tracks schema changes in schema_migrations -
    forward-only, applied exactly once, self-marking - but in its own python_backfills
    table rather than schema_migrations itself. schema_migrations' rows are meant to
    correspond 1:1 with the *.sql files db.migrate() finds under app/migrations; this is a
    one-off Python sweep with business logic (maybe_derive_price_targets), not a DDL file,
    and a synthetic entry in schema_migrations would break that correspondence for anyone
    auditing it against the files on disk. A dedicated table gets the same "applied once,
    tracked" discipline without that confusion.

    Safe to run against a large, real production table: every write goes through
    maybe_derive_price_targets, which only ever fills a NULL field and never overwrites a
    hand-set one (or an earlier auto-fill), so a second run - or a first run against rows
    already fixed by an incidental edit - is a no-op for those rows regardless of whether
    the sweep itself has already been marked done. The marker row exists purely to avoid
