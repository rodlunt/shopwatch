"""Retailer adapter framework.

One adapter per retailer. An adapter's only job is to turn a product page into a
normalised `Observation`. It must never guess: a value it could not determine stays
None, which the watcher records as unresolved. A None freight means "unknown", it does
not mean free shipping.

Adapters do not bypass CAPTCHAs or anti-bot measures. If a retailer blocks automated
requests, the adapter reports that and the value is maintained manually instead.
