"""Research jobs: the wizard's "let's go" step.

A job's own lifecycle lives here, in this container. The actual research (a
credentialed subprocess call to `claude`, real internet egress, real shared quota) never
runs in this process or this container - see `deploy/research-runner.py` for the
host-level script that claims a job over this same API, invokes `claude`, and reports
back, exactly the way `app/mailwatch.py` already does for retailer marketing email. The
token never enters this container; this module only ever talks to sqlite and answers
HTTP calls from that host script.

Whatever a `kind="price"` job finds still lands through the ordinary import path
(`app/ingest.py`), under the ordinary IMPORTED provenance state - a research job is not
a second, parallel way for prices to enter the database, only a new way to trigger
`POST /api/import`.

A `kind="historical_low"` job (issue #93) asks a different question - "has this ever
been cheaper, before tracking started" - and is answered once per job rather than once
per retailer. Its finding is never imported and never written to a product directly: it
sits on the job row (`historical_low_*`) purely as a suggestion for a human to copy into
the ordinary product-edit form, or discard.

    For kind="price" (the default, and the only kind this accepted before issue #93):
    a fixed set of retailers, one result row each. Default-deny by construction - a
    retailer id that is not already in the `retailers` table is silently dropped
    rather than passed through, so this can only ever ask about a retailer shopwatch
    already knows, never wherever a typo or a scraped page might lead the research
    pass.

    For kind="historical_low": no retailer selection at all. "Has this ever been
    cheaper" is one question about the product as a whole, not one answer per
    retailer, so retailer_ids is ignored and no research_job_results rows are created -
    the finding lands on the job itself (report_historical_low) for a human to review.

    `urls` is optional and keyed by retailer_id: when a retailer id has an entry, the
    runner reads that exact page instead of searching generically for the product at
    that retailer (see deploy/research-runner.py's `research_one_retailer`). This is
    the "paste a listing URL" path (issue #94) - the whole point of having a URL in
    hand is that the runner does not have to guess which page is the right one. A
    retailer id with no entry behaves exactly as before.

    Refuses outright for an archived product - "give up on this" (or a group purchase
    that archived every other candidate) means stop watching, and a stray research job
    against something nobody is hunting any more is exactly the wasted spend that
    guarantee exists to prevent.

    At most one active (QUEUED or RUNNING) job per product regardless of kind: the
    host runner processes one job at a time per product anyway, and a price job and a
    historical-low job both spend the same shared, credentialed CLI quota.
